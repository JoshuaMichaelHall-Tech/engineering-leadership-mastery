# DevOps/SRE Mastery for Financial Services

A repository documenting my systematic **42-week sequential learning journey** to DevOps expertise, targeting $250K+ senior DevOps roles in financial services. This approach emphasizes deep mastery through focused, sequential skill acquisition rather than concurrent learning.

## Sequential Learning Philosophy

**42-Week Structured Program** (50-60 hours/week):
- **Primary Learning** (30-40 hours): One technical focus at a time for deep mastery
- **Professional Networking** (10-12 hours): Consistent relationship building with 180+ financial services DevOps professionals
- **Job Preparation** (8-10 hours): Progressive development of job search materials and interview skills

**Available for mid-level DevOps Engineer roles: Week 30** | **Targeting senior-level positions: Week 42**

## Strategic Philosophy

> "Sequential mastery of critical skills creates exponentially more value than concurrent shallow learning across many domains."

This repository implements a **sequential, high-ROI approach** to DevOps/SRE mastery:
- **One Primary Task at a Time**: Complete books, courses, and projects sequentially for maximum retention
- **Professional Networking Integration**: The [professional-networking-tracker](https://github.com/JoshuaMichaelHall/professional-networking-tracker) as a core learning project
- **Financial Services Specialization**: Security-first approach with compliance automation focus
- **Quantifiable Business Value**: Every project demonstrates measurable ROI and business impact
- **Sustainable 42-Week Timeline**: Structured progression from foundation to principal-level capabilities
