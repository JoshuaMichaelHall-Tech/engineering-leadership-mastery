# Engineering Leadership & DevOps Management Mastery

A repository documenting my systematic **engineering management preparation journey** combining DevOps technical expertise with leadership development, targeting Director-level engineering roles ($350K-$500K+) in financial services. This approach emphasizes technical credibility building alongside management skills development.

## Engineering Management Philosophy

**Engineering Management Track Program** (30-40 hours/week):
- **Technical Foundation Building** (15-20 hours): AWS/Terraform expertise for management credibility
- **Leadership Development** (10-15 hours): Management fundamentals, team building, strategic thinking
- **Engineering Leadership Networking** (5-10 hours): Building relationships with engineering managers and directors
- **Management Content Creation** (5 hours): Thought leadership demonstrating management readiness

**Target: Engineering Team Lead roles (Year 1)** | **Engineering Manager positions (Year 2)** | **Director-level roles (Year 5-6)**

## Strategic Philosophy

> "Engineering managers need both technical credibility and leadership skills - this journey builds both systematically."

This repository implements a **management-track focused approach** to engineering leadership:
- **Technical Credibility Foundation**: AWS/Terraform expertise demonstrating engineering competence
- **Leadership Skills Development**: Team management, strategic thinking, and business impact measurement
- **Management Networking Strategy**: Building relationships with engineering managers and directors
- **Business-Focused Projects**: Every technical project demonstrates team leadership and business value
- **Management Content Strategy**: Thought leadership positioning for engineering management roles
- **Systematic Management Preparation**: Progression from technical foundation to leadership readiness

## Repository Purpose

This is a public technical repository focused on:

1. **Management Learning Resources**: Engineering leadership fundamentals and team management guides
2. **Leadership-Focused Projects**: Technical projects demonstrating team coordination and business impact
3. **Technical Credibility Building**: Strategic AWS/Terraform certifications for management credibility
4. **Management Networking Materials**: Engineering leadership relationship building strategies
5. **Business Impact Documentation**: Measuring and communicating technical work in business terms
