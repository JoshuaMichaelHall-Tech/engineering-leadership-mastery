What three things are required to create an AWS account?|1. Account name 2. Unique email address 3. Credit card for billing|AWS_Account_Fundamentals
What is the AWS root user and why is it important?|The root user is created automatically with the account, has unrestricted access to all resources, and cannot be limited. Best practice: use sparingly and secure with MFA.|AWS_Account_Fundamentals

What are the 4 types of authentication factors for MFA?|Knowledge (something you know), Possession (something you have), Inherent (something you are - biometric), Location (somewhere you are)|AWS_Account_Fundamentals
How do you access AWS billing and cost management?|Root user → Account dropdown → Billing → Set up billing preferences and create budgets with email notifications|AWS_Account_Fundamentals
What are the key characteristics of AWS IAM?|Free service, Global scope (not region-specific), Globally resilient, Purpose: manage identities and permissions within an AWS account|IAM_Identity_and_Access_Management
What is the principle of least privilege in IAM?|Grant only the minimum permissions necessary for users/services to perform their required tasks|IAM_Identity_and_Access_Management
What permissions do IAM identities start with by default?|No permissions - all access must be explicitly granted|IAM_Identity_and_Access_Management
What are the 4 main IAM components?|1. Users (people/apps) 2. Groups (collections of users) 3. Roles (for services/external access) 4. Policies (JSON permission documents)|IAM_Identity_and_Access_Management
How many passwords and access keys can an IAM user have?|One username/password and up to 2 access keys|IAM_Identity_and_Access_Management
What is an IAM policy?|A JSON document that defines permissions, can be attached to users, groups, or roles|IAM_Identity_and_Access_Management
What's the recommended alternative to using the root user for daily tasks?|Create an IAMADMIN user with AdministratorAccess policy|IAM_Identity_and_Access_Management
What are the steps to create a secure IAMADMIN user?|1. Create account alias 2. Create IAM user 3. Attach AdministratorAccess policy 4. Set strong password 5. Enable MFA 6. Use instead of root|IAM_Identity_and_Access_Management
What are the two components of an IAM access key?|Access Key ID (public) and Secret Access Key (private - shown only once)|IAM_Access_Keys
What are the limitations of IAM access keys?|Maximum 2 per user, only for users (not roles), can be activated/deactivated|IAM_Access_Keys
Can IAM roles use access keys?|No, access keys are only for IAM users, not roles|IAM_Access_Keys
What security best practice should you follow with access keys?|Rotate them regularly and store them securely|IAM_Access_Keys
What command installs AWS CLI v2 on macOS?|curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg" && sudo installer -pkg AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /|AWS_CLI_Configuration
What command configures an AWS CLI profile?|aws configure --profile <profile-name>|AWS_CLI_Configuration
What 4 pieces of information does 'aws configure' ask for?|1. Access Key ID 2. Secret Access Key 3. Default region (e.g., us-east-1) 4. Default output format|AWS_CLI_Configuration
How do you test if AWS CLI is configured correctly?|Run: aws s3 ls --profile <profile-name> - Success = no error message|AWS_CLI_Configuration
Why use named profiles with AWS CLI?|To manage multiple AWS accounts/environments from the same machine|AWS_CLI_Configuration
What is the recommended AWS account structure for learning/development?|1. Management Account (primary login, billing, IAMADMIN user) 2. Production Account (separate workloads, own root + IAMADMIN)|AWS_Account_Architecture
Why should you create separate AWS accounts for different environments?|Security containerization - if one account is compromised, damage is limited to that account only|AWS_Account_Architecture
What network ranges were used in the Animals4Life case study?|On-prem: 192.168.10.0/24 (Class C), AWS Pilot: 10.0.0.0/16 (Class A), Azure Pilot: 172.31.0.0/16 (Class B)|AWS_Account_Architecture
Where do you configure AWS cost alerts and budgets?|Root user → Account dropdown → Billing → Billing Preferences|Cost_Management
What cost control features should you enable immediately?|1. Billing preferences with email delivery 2. Cost alerts 3. Budget with email notifications|Cost_Management
Why is it important to grant IAM users access to billing information?|So non-root users can monitor costs and budgets without needing root access|Cost_Management
What should you do immediately after creating a root user?|Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)|Security_Best_Practices
How often should you use the root user account?|As rarely as possible - only for tasks that require root permissions|Security_Best_Practices
What's the security model for new IAM identities?|Explicit allow/deny model - start with no permissions|Security_Best_Practices
Why create new AWS accounts for each course or major project?|To maintain clean separation, easy cleanup, and prevent accidental resource conflicts|Security_Best_Practices
What were the main problems in the Animals4Life case study?|Legacy on-prem failing (18-month deadline), failed cloud pilots, performance issues, no HA/scalability, limited automation skills, high expansion costs|Real-World_Application
What were the desired outcomes for Animals4Life's cloud migration?|Fast performance, quick regional deployment, cost-effective scaling, business agility, IoT/Big Data capabilities, automation|Real-World_Application
What types of users need to be considered in a global organization?|HQ staff, remote workers, field workers with varying connectivity (3G/4G/Satellite)|Real-World_Application
Why did the initial cloud pilots fail for Animals4Life?|Messy implementation, expensive, no performance improvement over on-premises|Real-World_Application
What does "globally resilient" mean for IAM?|IAM is replicated across all AWS regions automatically, providing high availability|IAM_Deep_Dive
Can IAM in one account control users in another account?|No, IAM has no direct control over external accounts or users (but can use federation)|IAM_Deep_Dive
What is identity federation in IAM?|Ability to grant access to AWS resources to users authenticated by external identity providers|IAM_Deep_Dive
Where do you manage IAM access keys?|Login → Security Credentials → Access Keys → Create/Manage|IAM_Deep_Dive
What should you add when creating an access key?|A descriptive tag to identify the key's purpose|IAM_Deep_Dive
How many MFA devices should you configure per account?|Virtual MFA for each user for each account (root + all IAM users)|IAM_Deep_Dive
