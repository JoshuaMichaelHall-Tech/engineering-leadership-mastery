# Containerized Microservices Platform - Engineering Leadership Project

## Business Purpose & Management Learning

This project implements a production-ready containerized microservices platform designed for financial services applications, demonstrating both technical expertise and engineering management capabilities. It showcases team leadership through comprehensive documentation, knowledge transfer practices, and strategic technical decision-making required for engineering management roles.

## Business Value & Management Impact

- **Team Productivity**: Reduce release cycle time from weeks to hours/days through improved team workflows
- **Resource Management**: Improve infrastructure utilization by 40-60% with better team coordination
- **Operational Excellence**: Achieve 99.95% service availability through automated recovery and team processes
- **Developer Experience**: Standardized environments reduce onboarding time and improve team efficiency
- **Compliance Leadership**: Built-in security controls demonstrate ability to manage regulatory requirements
- **Management Demonstration**: Comprehensive documentation and knowledge transfer practices showcase leadership readiness

## Architecture

### Platform Components

The platform consists of several integrated layers:

1. **Container Infrastructure**: Kubernetes cluster with proper production configuration
2. **Service Mesh**: Network communication, security, and traffic management
3. **Observability Stack**: Monitoring, logging, and alerting infrastructure
4. **Security Layer**: Security scanning, policy enforcement, and compliance tools
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Deployment pipelines and automation

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### 1. Kubernetes Environment
- Production-grade Kubernetes cluster with multi-AZ deployment
- Advanced RBAC configuration with least privilege implementation
- Network policies for service-to-service communication control
- Resource quotas and limits for predictable performance

#### 2. Containerized Services
- API Gateway service for external traffic management
- User authentication and authorization services
- Financial transaction processing services
- Account management and reporting services
- All implemented with security-hardened container images

#### 3. Observability Implementation
- Prometheus for metrics collection and alerting
- Grafana dashboards for visualization
- ELK stack for log aggregation and analysis
- Jaeger for distributed tracing
- Custom financial services dashboards

#### 4. Security Controls
- Container vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- Runtime security with Falco
- Admission controllers for policy enforcement
- Secret management with HashiCorp Vault
- Image signing and validation

#### 5. CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions for automated builds and testing
- ArgoCD for GitOps-based deployments
- Automated security scanning integration
- Deployment approval workflows for regulated environments

## Financial Services Considerations

### Compliance Controls

- **SOX Compliance**:
  - Complete audit trail for all deployments
  - Separation of duties through RBAC
  - Change management documentation

- **PCI-DSS Implementation**:
  - Network segmentation for cardholder data
  - Encryption for data in transit and at rest
  - Vulnerability management workflow

- **GDPR Controls**:
  - Data isolation mechanisms
  - Personal data handling policies
  - Access control and auditing

### Security Implementation

- **Zero Trust Architecture**:
  - Service-to-service authentication and authorization
  - mTLS for all service communication
  - Minimal network connectivity between services

- **Automated Security Validation**:
  - Container scanning in CI/CD pipeline
  - Regular vulnerability assessments
  - Compliance policy enforcement

- **Data Protection**:
  - Encryption at rest for persistent volumes
  - Encryption in transit for all communications
  - Key rotation and management

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Container Orchestration**:
  - Kubernetes cluster management
  - Service deployment and scaling
  - StatefulSet implementation

- **Microservices Architecture**:
  - Service design and implementation
  - API gateway patterns
  - Service discovery

- **DevOps Practices**:
  - CI/CD pipeline implementation
  - Infrastructure as Code (Kubernetes manifests)
  - GitOps workflow

- **Security Engineering**:
  - Container security hardening
  - Network security implementation
  - Compliance control automation

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (EKS, GKE, or local kind/minikube)
- kubectl configured for your cluster
- Helm v3+ installed
- Docker and access to container registry
- GitHub account for CI/CD

### Deployment Steps

1. Clone this repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joshuamichaelhall/container-platform.git
   cd container-platform
   ```

2. Deploy infrastructure components
   ```bash
   helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
   helm repo update
   helm install monitoring prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack -f kubernetes/monitoring/values.yaml
   ```

3. Deploy application services
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/base/namespaces.yaml
   kubectl apply -k kubernetes/overlays/dev
   ```

4. Verify deployment
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n application
   kubectl get svc -n application
   ```

5. Access monitoring dashboards
   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward svc/monitoring-grafana 3000:80 -n monitoring
   ```
