# Platform Engineering Certification Path v2.0

**Updated**: February 2025  
**Target Role**: Senior Platform Engineer → Engineering Manager (2-3 years)  
**Strategy**: Technical credibility through platform expertise, not immediate management

## Overview

This simplified certification path focuses on establishing deep platform engineering credibility first, with management opportunities emerging after 2-3 years of proven technical expertise.

## Certification Timeline - 48 Weeks

### Phase 1: Kubernetes Foundation (Weeks 1-10)
| Certification | Week | Cost | Strategic Value |
|---------------|------|------|-----------------|
| Security+ Renewal | Week 4 | $472 | Maintain security credential |
| **CKA** | Week 10 | $695 | Core platform engineering signal |

**Focus**: Deep Kubernetes expertise from Day 1. This is the most critical certification for platform engineering roles.

### Phase 2: Cloud Platform (Weeks 11-24)
| Certification | Week | Cost | Strategic Value |
|---------------|------|------|-----------------|
| AWS SAA | Week 18 | $445 | Cloud fundamentals |
| Terraform Associate | Week 24 | $270 | Infrastructure as Code |

**Focus**: Build cloud platform skills on top of Kubernetes foundation.

### Phase 3: Specialization (Weeks 25-36)
| Certification | Week | Cost | Strategic Value |
|---------------|------|------|-----------------|
| FinOps Practitioner | Week 30 | $800 | Cost optimization expertise |
| **AWS Security Specialty** | Week 36 | $300 | Advanced security for financial services |

**Focus**: Differentiate with cost optimization (leveraging P&L experience) and security depth.

## What Changed from v1

### Removed
- ❌ AWS DevOps Professional (too broad)
- ❌ CKS (chose AWS Security instead)
- ❌ AWS SA Professional (Year 2-3 instead)
- ❌ Engineering Management Program (premature)
- ❌ 10+ certification marathon

### Added/Adjusted
- ✅ CKA as primary focus (Week 10)
- ✅ FinOps for unique differentiation
- ✅ Simplified to 6 certifications
- ✅ Realistic timeline (48 weeks)
- ✅ Contract-to-hire optimization

## Platform Engineering Focus

### Why Platform Engineering First
1. **Market Reality**: Can't jump to management without recent technical experience
2. **Credibility**: Need to prove technical skills before leading engineers
3. **Salary Path**: $150-180K → $225K → $320K+ more realistic than $240K start
4. **Success Rate**: 75% for senior IC vs 40% for direct management

### Technical Skills Priority
1. **Kubernetes** - Master containerization and orchestration
2. **GitOps** - Modern deployment patterns
3. **Security** - Critical for financial services
4. **Cost Optimization** - Leverage business background
5. **Observability** - Platform reliability

## Career Progression Strategy

### Year 1: Senior Platform Engineer
- Target: $150-180K via contract-to-hire
- Focus: Technical excellence and team collaboration
- Build: Platform engineering portfolio
- Demonstrate: Business value through cost optimization

### Year 2: Lead Platform Engineer
- Target: $190-210K
- Add: Technical leadership responsibilities
- Mentor: Junior engineers
- Lead: Small technical projects
- Apply: Stanford LEAD program

### Year 3-4: Platform Engineering Manager
- Target: $225-275K
- Transition: Formal management role
- Leverage: Technical credibility built in Years 1-2
- Focus: Team development and strategic initiatives

## Study Approach

### Weeks 1-10: Kubernetes Intensive
- 3 hours daily minimum
- Hands-on practice focus
- Build production-like systems
- Join CNCF community

### Weeks 11-36: Sustainable Pace
- 2-3 hours daily study
- Balance with consulting (10-15 hrs/week)
- Focus on practical application
- Build portfolio projects

### Weeks 37-48: Interview Preparation
- Platform engineering scenarios
- System design practice
- Security architecture discussions
- Cost optimization case studies

## Financial Investment

| Category | Cost |
|----------|------|
| Certifications | $2,982 |
| MIT AI Business Strategy | $3,200 |
| Books/Labs | $1,500 |
| Cloud Infrastructure | $1,000 |
| **Total** | $8,682 |
